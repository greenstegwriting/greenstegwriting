      <description>We begin as the setting sun purples the sky. A few pink clouds hang overhead, glowing slightly as the last few rays of sun filter through them. The sky is a thousand-acre watercolor, an endless yet paper-thin canvas that only nature, or perhaps the supernatural, has the nimbleness to paint on, a masterpiece that so many artists have tried and failed to tame for themselves.
I kick off and start pedaling in the street, with him not too far behind.</description>

      <description>Hello, and welcome to greensteg&amp;rsquo;s blog! In case you were wondering (and even if you weren&amp;rsquo;t), greensteg is short for green stegosaurus; when I was a kid, all of the models of stegosauruses that I saw were green, and thus greensteg was born. For a quick bit of background, I&amp;rsquo;m currently a student in statistics and math graduating from -insert school here- this year and working at -insert company here- next year.</description>
