Hello, and welcome to greensteg's blog! In case you were wondering (and even if you weren't), greensteg is short for green stegosaurus; when I was a kid, all of the models of stegosauruses that I saw were green, and thus greensteg was born. For a quick bit of background, I'm currently a student in statistics and math graduating from _-insert school here-_ this year and working at _-insert company here-_ next year. I used to think of myself as an aspiring mathemusician, but nowadays I've figured out that, well, I really don't have anything figured out.

Writing is something that I've always wanted to do somewhat well. As an avid reader (particularly of Murakami), I find it easy to lose myself within the worlds that others create, but in doing so I often forget how much thought and effort is put into the process of creating such beautiful landscapes and destinations. This site (or blog, whatever it is) is then an attempt to become a better writer, in particular in fiction, and maybe even an attempt to get to know myself better.
