We begin as the setting sun purples the sky. A few pink clouds hang overhead, glowing slightly as the last few rays of sun filter through them. The sky is a thousand-acre watercolor, an endless yet paper-thin canvas that only nature, or perhaps the supernatural, has the nimbleness to paint on, a masterpiece that so many artists have tried and failed to tame for themselves.

I kick off and start pedaling in the street, with him not too far behind. Soon, the sodium-vapor streetlamps flicker on and tint the streets with their orange light. We meander north, cruising through the streets with the ghosts of cars following us. After a while, we stop near a brook on the edge of town. Dusk falls, slowly bringing layers of deep blues and dark hues into the sky. The water trembles slightly as the wind ripples its surface.

As we venture further north, the paved road eventually ends and a dirt road takes its place.
